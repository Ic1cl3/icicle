    <p>> I'm a nerd who happens to be in to programming, gamedev, cs in general, math, and just about anything else STEM related.</p>
    <p>> I also enjoy writing as well as geography and history, and I love hiking.</p>
    <p>> I would not call myself a music fanatic, but I am definitely a fan. I mainly play keys, but I have dabbled in both vessle flute and accordian. I mostly listen to EDM and jazz.</p>
    <p>> Games I enjoy include Undertale, The Legend of Zelda, Subnautica, Pokemon, and Minecraft.</p>
    <p>> Certified conversationally akward.</p>
    <p>> Oh yeah, I also absolutely HATE two things: tomatoes and reading novels. Those two things are literally the bane of my existstence and I don't know why. I kinda wish they weren't. Sorry.</p>
